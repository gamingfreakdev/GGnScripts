GGnScripts
==========
This a git repository for scripts that have been created for GGn. This includes Steam Uploady, GOG Uploady, and a few other misc. ones that were created along the way. This is just a nicer way of keeping them all together.

* BadCover - For people moderating the image locations of the covers
* CommentsNotifier - Gives notifications when a comment has been placed on an uploaded torrent
* GOGUploady - Uses GOG instead of Steam for uploady
* LightboxFullScreen - Uses only the full screen to show the image
* SnatchList - A Snatch list script to show what you have snatched whilst browsing the site
* SteamUploady - An uploady script that takes the information from the steam store and places it in the correct fields
